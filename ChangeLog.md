# 1.4.260907
1. Add experimental macOS backend (AppKit, Core Graphics, Core Text, ImageIO),
   Retina buffers, UTF-8/IME input, clipboard, main-thread timers,
   embedded/modal windows and status items.
2. Build macOS application bundles for all examples and add platform integration tests.
3. Add experimental WebAssembly backend (Emscripten, Canvas 2D), browser windows,
   Unicode/composition input, clipboard events and single-threaded timers.
   Preserve the desktop event-loop contract using Asyncify.
4. Build all three examples for static web hosting and add integration tests
   for Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, including touch-focus scenarios.
5. Keep the active framework implementation alive until its event loop returns.
6. Replace the main demo with an interactive seven-page Showcase covering controls,
   dialogs, text editing, filtered lists, menus, custom drawing and split layouts.
   Preserve page state and support switching between light and dark themes.
7. Draw toggle and radio indicators with primitives instead of PNG resources;
   add the classic button_view::checkbox, keyboard activation and theme sizing.
8. Improve single-line and multiline input selection, Unicode editing, newline
   handling, clipboard operations and drag autoscrolling; add regression tests.
9. Fix text disappearing when scrolling single-line and read-only inputs.
   Remove the blinking insertion caret in read-only fields while preserving
   selection and copying.
10. Keep scrollbars visible at full width and fix their rendering on macOS and WASM.
11. Make Ctrl/Cmd+A independent of the keyboard layout in the browser backend.
12. Focus browser text entry only for editable inputs, avoiding unconditional
    software-keyboard activation when tapping the window or read-only text.
13. Fix browser-window jumps when dragging across coordinate -1, which was
    incorrectly interpreted as a request to center the window.
14. Fix hello_world image resource paths and missing heading styles.
15. Fix propagation of size_changed events to plain subscribers for docked windows;
    add missing <cstdint> includes in locale_selector.hpp and theme_selector.hpp.
16. Update English and Russian documentation, API examples, platform build guides
    and documentation deployment; add dedicated text and scroll control guides.
